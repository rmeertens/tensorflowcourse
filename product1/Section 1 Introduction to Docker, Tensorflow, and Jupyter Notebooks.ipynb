    "People often discuss whether being good at deep learning requires a lot of knowledge (like a scientist), or requires a lot of practice (like an artist). With these questions the answer always is: you need to have a combination of both. Only solving a lot of datasets will give you the intuition to build neural networks for new datasets. However, if you want to solve your problems better than anyone else, you will need to know exactly why you apply certain techniques in neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a [scientific paper from 1994](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=181522) scientists already see this problem coming. Now deep learning is very popular many people want to use it on their own datasets. Many will achieve results that are satisfactory, but only really understanding the problem allows you to solve the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this course you will learn to be a network artist and a network scientist at the same time.  practicing on many datasets will give you a good intuition in what techniques you can apply for certain problems. We discuss what techniques do, and immediately use this to solve datasets. After you are done with the course you can revisit the first problems you faced and use the knowledge you gained to solve the first few problems even better!\n",
